# Blockchain-Network-Simulator
This is a simple Blockchain Network Simulator. The creators are Jian Xiang, Fangqing Xu, YanLan Liang who are the Master students of Information Technology in Rutgers University.

I still try to make the simulator more powerful and adaptive to the real world. Keep updating.
